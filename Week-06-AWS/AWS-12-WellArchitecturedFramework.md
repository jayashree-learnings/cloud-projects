# AWS Well Architected Framework
The principles of AWS Well Architected Framework helps cloud architects and customers to build a cloud infrastructure which is secure, resilient, secure and efficient.

## Exercise
1. Study the Well Architected Framework
 
### Sources

### Overcome challenges

Had to understand how each pillar is contributing to the well architected framework.

### Results
1) The 6 pillars of AWS Well Architected Framework are 

- operational excellence - Intended to run and monitor systems and to continually improve supporting processes. The 5 design principles are 
    - perform operations as code - 
    - make frequent , small , reversible changes - 
    - refine operations procedures frequently
    - anticipate failure
    - learn from all operational failures

- security -  It is the ability to protect information, systems and assets and to assess risks and formulate mitigation strategies.
The 7 design principles of security are
    - implement a strong identity foundation
    - enable traceability
    - apply security at all layers
    - automate security best practices
    - protect data in transit and at rest
    - keep people away from data
    - prepare for security events

- reliability - Defined as the ability of the system to recover from infrastructure disruptions, dynamically acquire computing sources to meet demand and reduce the impact of misconfigurations  and network issues.It is based on 5 design principles
    - automatically recover from failure
    - test recovery procedures
    - scale horizontally to increase workload availability
    - stop guessing capacity
    - manage change in automation

- perform efficiency - The objective is to use the computing resources efficiently and to maintain the efficiency when technologies evolve or demand changes.It is based on 5 design principles
    - democratize advanced technologies
    - go global in minutes
    - use serverless architecture
    - experiment more often
    - consider mechanical sympathy

- cost optimization - It is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. It is based on the 5 principles of 
    - implement cloud financial management
    - adopt a consumption model
    - measure overall efficiency
    - stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - analyze and attribute expenditure

- sustainability - The aim is to reduce the environmental impacts while running a cloud infrastructure.
It is based on the 6 principles of
    - understand your impact
    - establish sustainability goals
    - maximize utilization
    - adopt more efficient hardware and software solutions
    - use managed services
    - reduce downstream impact of your cloud workloads.
