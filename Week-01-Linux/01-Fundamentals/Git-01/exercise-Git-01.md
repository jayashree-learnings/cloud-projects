#  Git and github

Git is an open source distributed version control tool , enabling to push and pull the changes to and from repos on other computers.This enables multiple developers to work on the same project.

Github is a cloud based service that allows developers to store and manage their code, track it, control the changes to the code among other tools like bitbucket makes it easier to work with git.
 
## Key terminologies

 1. repository-Container that tracks the changes to your project files.
 2. branch-A branch created from an existing branch is like a full copy of the current branch.main purpose is to separate specific commits to avoid conflicts and merge them later when they are ready to go.
 3. commit-records the changes in the local repo
 4. push-the recorded changes made by commit is updated on the remote repo
 6. merge-A way to integrate the changes in two branches.
 7. fork- usually done on public projects so that we can create a perzonalized version of the same project.

### Overcome challenges
 
The following steps were undertaken to push a sample text file from a local folder to the newly created repository.

1)Created a github account.

2)Installed GitHub Desktop which provides a GUI to integrate the local repository changes easily with the github.

3)Created a local repository via GithubDesktop.

4)Added a sample text file into this repo. The change in the local repo was reflected in the GitHubDesktop.It showed `+` signs against the lines that were added.(`-` will be shown when lines are removed.)

5)To push the code to the github,

a)committed the code by clicking on "commit to main" button.

b)pusblihed by clicking on "publish repository" button.

6)The repository is visible in the github account now.

### Results

created a repo using github desktop
