#  Linux-Files and Directories
In Linux,everything is stored as files and folders.Its important to understand the basic file and folder structure in linux,creation of files and folders, removing them, changing directories and using absolute and relative path.The base directory is the root directory. It contains different directories like /bin, /etc, /dev /home,/opt etc each meant for a specific purpose.


## Key terminology

  1. pwd- to know the present working directory

  2. cd - change directory

  3. ls -al - to list all the files and folders in the current directory.It shows who is the owner,group and others with their permissions.

  4. mkdir -to make a directory

  5. Absolute path- refers to the entire path starting from the root directory

  6. relative path - refers to the path starting from the directory the user is currently in

### Overcome challenges
Had to look up for the difference between absolute and relative path.
Understood the difference when I executed the cd commands 
1) by giving the full path starting from the root and 

2) another path relative to the pwd.

### Results

finding current directory, listing files & folders, craeting new folder techgrounds
