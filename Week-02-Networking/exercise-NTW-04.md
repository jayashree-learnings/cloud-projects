#  Number Systems

The 3 different types of number sytems are 

1) Binary - Its calculated to the base 2 and consists of 0 and 1.

2) Decimal - Its calcualted to the base 10. Consists of digits from 0 to 9.

3) Hexadecimal - It is calculated to the base 16. Consists of digits from 0 to 9 and alphabets a(corresponding to 10) to f (corresponding to 15).

## Key terminologies
bit - 0 or 1

byte - 8 bits make one byte

base - the number of values in the counting sytem

### Overcome challenges
Had to look up for the conversion between
1)  decimal and hexadecimal and 2) decimal and binary

For the conversion from decimal to binary, write the values corresponding to the powers of two starting from zero to seven.Then find the numbers which adds up to the given number. Eg-228 is sum of 128,64,32 and 4. Write 1 below these and fill the remaining with zeros.

For the conversion from binary to decimal, write the ons and zeros below the numbers corresponding to the powers of 2. Add the values corresponding to 1.

For conversion from decimal to hexadcimal, the steps are as follows

1) Divide the number by 16 and note its quotient and remainder,R.
   37/16 = 2.3125 = 2R(16*.33125) = 2 R 5
2) Keep on dividing till the whole number part becomes zero
  2/16 = 0.125 = 0 R(16*.125) = 0 R 2
3) Write the value of the remainder from bottom to top.

For the conversion from hexadecimal to decimal , multiply the last digit with a value of 16 raised to zero, the next digit with 16 raised to one and so on(moving from right to left). Take the sum of the above values.
