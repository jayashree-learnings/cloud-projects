##  OSI and tcp/ip models

The two common models referred to networking are the OSI model developed by ISO in 1984 and tcp/ip model developed by the DoD(Department of Defense) in 1960.The OSI model with its 7 layer architecture is considered as a logical model and is mainly used as a reference model, where as the tcp/ip model is considered to be more accurate and reliable.

##  OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) stack

 It is a conceptual model created by ISO ,consisiting of 7 layers. Each layer represents different component of network communication. The 7 layers are 

Application layer- It defines the protocols that applications use to exchange data and it is the layer that interacts with the user directly.Eg- web browsers(google chrome), email applications(outlook), chat applications(whats app, skype) etc 

Presentation layer- mainly deals with data format like encryption, decryption, compression, decompresssion etc.

Session layer- Responsible to establish , manage and terminate the communication between two hosts.

transportation layer - Responsible for taking the entire message across the connected devices. It mainly deals with the port number, TCP/UDP protocols. Breaks  a large file into small segments to reduce data loss

Network layer - This layer enables connectivity and path selection of hosts located at different locations. It deals with the ip address of the hosts.

Data Layer - This layer defines how data is formatted for transmission.Switches operate at this layer. It corcerned about the mac address of the connected hosta.

Physical layer - Defines how the physical components like cables, connectors are supposed to work together to enable bit wise transmission of data.

### Use cases/ Real time Applications of OSI model

To understand networking and trouble shoot the isssues 

To identify the biggest data security issues inside an organisation as it provides a framework for doing an inventory of the firm's assets

Helps to identify the precise data security concerns when migrating to the cloud.

Helps in securing cloud infrastructure as we can update the OSI model to reflect the operational layers in IAAS. 


# TCP/IP model(Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol)

Consists of 4 layers.Considered to be more realistic than the OSI stack. The 4 layers are 

Application layer - consists of application ,presentation and session layer of the OSI model

Transport layer - Same as that of the OSI model

Internet layer - Same as the network layer of OSI model

Network access layer - Data link and physical layers of the OSI model combinedly is called the network access of the TCP/IP model.

### Use cases/ Real time Applications of tcp/ip

SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Prorocol) - To send mail

FTP(File Transfer Protocol)- to send large files

DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)- to Assign ip address automatically 

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)- to transfer web pages

DNS(Domain NAme System)- To translate website to ip address

SNTP(Simple Network Time Potocol) - to provide time of a day to network devices.

telnet- bi directional text communication via terminal application


## Key terminologies

OSI model

tcp/ip model

## Exercise

1. Study the OSI model and its uses.

2. Study the TCP/IP model and its uses.

### Overcome challenges

Had to understand the comparison of both OSI and  tcp/ip model.

# Results
Both the models were studied and compared.
