#  Python variables
Variables provide an easy way to store the values and use it at a later stage making the code management easy. The value of a variable can change at different points depending on the requirement. The variables are case sensitive, can be of any data type and each language has its own conventions to be followed while naming a variable.

## Key terminologies
Assignment operator, = Is used to assign values to the variable.
Some of naming conventions are
 - Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, under score etc and should not contain key words.
 - It should never start with a number, but can start with under score, alphabets 
 - The name should be descriptive enough to understand its purpose
 - Multiple words are separated by underscore

## Exercise
1. Create a new script.Create two variables x and y. Assign a numerical value to both variables.Print the values of x and y.Create a third variable named z. The value of z should be the sum of x and y.Print the value of z.

2. Create a new script.Create a variable name. The value of name should be your name.Print the text “Hello, <your name here>!”. Use name in the print statement.

3. Create a new script.Create a variable and assign a value to it.	Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.	Change the value of that same variable. Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.Change the value of that same variable.

### Overcome challenges
Looked up on how to reassign a new value to a variable which already has been assigned with a value. Understood that a new value can reassigned by simply using '=' operator. 

### Results
1) Created a script in which 2 variables were assigned with int values. A third variable was used to store the summation of the above 2 variables and the result was displayed.

2) Created a variable to store the name. This variable was printed along with the greeting in the print statement.

3) Created 2 variables and assigned values to it.Printed the values of these variables.
Reassigned the second variable with a new value and when it was printed it displayed the changed value.
