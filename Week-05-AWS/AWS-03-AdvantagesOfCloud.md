#  Advantages of Cloud computing

The cloud computing when compared to the traditional on premise infrastructure has many advantages. The underlying heavy work is done by public cloud providers so that organizations can focus more on their business rather than worrying about provisioning and maintaining resources. 

## Key terminologies

Reliability - AWS has a Service Level Agreement which makes its solutions reliable.

Agility - Instant access to services and resources for the developers which in turn results in increased agility of the organization as the speed to the marker increases. 

Scalability - Scale up or down (increase/decrease the resources) as needed. 

Global reach - User can choose a specific region anywhere in the world.

High availability - The systems will be always up and running.

pay-as-you-go - Pay for what you consume and how much you consume.

### Overcome challenges

Had to understand why an organization should adopt cloud computing. Understood it by going through the benefits of cloud computing. 


### Results

The 6 advantages of cloud computing are 

- Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx) - Instead of having to make a huge upfront payment for resources which are not sure to be used, the payment is done only for the resources consumed and the amount depends on how much it is used.     

- Benefit from massive economies of scale - As the number of customers increase, it leads to higher economy of scale . They can pass those volume discounts to customers, thus the customers need to pay lower pay-as-you-go price.

- Stop guessing capacity - In cloud computing, the capacity is matched to your demand. The organizations do not have to guess about the capacity which might lead to expensive resources sitting idle or dealing with the problem arising from under estimated resources. 

- Increase speed and agility - In cloud computing, many resources are available at the click of a button, which increases the speed to market making it in a few minutes compared to the traditional weeks.

- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers -  As the data centres are maintained by the AWS, organizations can stop worrying about them and concentrate on the business at hand. 

- Go global in minutes - As AWS has servers all over the world, the applications can be deployed in minutes any desired location.
